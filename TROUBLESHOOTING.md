## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Test Credentials First
Always manually test credentials in a browser before adding them to test data.

### Tip 2: Environment-Specific Data
Create separate test data sets for each environment:
- `Admin User - Dev` (dev credentials)
- `Admin User - QA` (QA credentials)  
- `Admin User - Prod` (prod credentials)

### Tip 3: Keep Credentials Updated
When passwords change, update your test data sets immediately.
